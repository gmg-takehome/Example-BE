**Example Node Backend**

Since this is just an example, the instructions would not actually work, and the code would also not work.

Here would go some brief description of the project

For more information, check the [Wiki](https://github.com/gmg-takehome/Example-BE/wiki)

**Prerequisites**

 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

*Non-docker setup*
 
 - [Node (version number)](https://nodejs.org/en)
 - [MySQL (version number)](https://www.mysql.com/)

**Docker Setup**

*First time*

Perhaps some instructions go here about file structure or ENV set up and don't forget to install dependancies

*Spin up container*

Run the following commands:

 - `docker compose up -d`

You can now access the page via `localhost:SomePort`

**Non-docker setup**

*First time*

 - Set up MySQL
 - Set up Node
 - Install dependancies

*Spin up server*

 - Some run command `node app.js`

While seeds are provided, it is best to recieve an up-to-date db from the staging environment
